Tyrion's elder sister Cersei is the Queen of Westeros by virtue of her marriage to King Robert Baratheon, and Cersei's male twin Jaime is one of the Kingsguard, the royal security detail.

She has five siblings: older brother Robb, younger brothers Bran and Rickon, older sister Sansa, and the eldest of the group, illegitimate half-brother Jon Snow. In direct contrast to Sansa, Arya shows no interest in dancing, singing, and sewing, and revels in fighting and exploring, much to the chagrin of her mother and tutor Septa Mordane. She is particularly close to her bastard half-brother Jon Snow, who encourages her to learn to fight and gives her Needle (her sword). Throughout her travels, Arya displays great resourcefulness and cunning, and becomes increasingly ruthless.",

Jaime's twin is Cersei, the Queen of Westeros by virtue of her marriage to King Robert Baratheon. Perhaps the greatest swordsman in the kingdom, Jaime is sometimes derisively called 'the Kingslayer' because he killed the 'Mad King' Aerys Targaryen in the coup that put Robert on the Iron Throne.Eric Dodds of Time described Jaime as 'handsome, an incomparably skilled fighter and disarmingly witty', with The New Yorker calling the Lannisters 'a crowd of high-cheekboned beauties ... who form a family constellation so twisted, charismatic, and cruel that it rivals Flowers in the Attic for blond dysfunction'. Lev Grossman wrote for Time that while Jaime and Cersei's younger brother Tyrion is a grotesque dwarf, 'the rest of the Lannisters are stunted too, but on the inside.'",

  "description": "In A Game of Thrones (1996), Jon Snow is the 14-year-old bastard son of Eddard 'Ned' Stark, lord of Winterfell, and half-brother to Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. Described as having strong Stark features with a lean build, long face, dark brown hair and grey eyes, he has the surname 'Snow'—customary for illegitimate children in the North—and is resented by Stark's wife Catelyn as a reminder of Ned's affair. Jon is the same age as Robb and enjoys a warm relationship with his siblings, particularly the tomboy Arya, who resembles Jon and, like him, does not feel like she fits in. Ned treats Jon as much like his other children as propriety and his honor will allow; still, as somewhat of an outsider, Jon has learned to be independent and to fend for himself when necessary. Jon idolizes his father, but is wounded by Ned's refusal to identify his mother. At the beginning of the story, Jon adopts the albino direwolf he names Ghost; he later finds that at times he can 'inhabit' the wolf and share its experiences.",

The moral compass of the story, he is content to remain far from courtly intrigues and is unwavering in his view of loyalty and honor.
